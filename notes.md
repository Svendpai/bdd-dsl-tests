go through it manually to see just how wrong it is

get a case to see how an end-user could fix it

scemantically wrong - ok
syntatically wrong - not okay

produce syntactically correct grammar

LLM respect the grammar and make wrong choices

- could make a fork and rewrite and fix the grammar (not important tho)

call it it scenario 1 or 2, in the intermediary process (functionally doesn't matter)

---

It would be nice, to see if the LLM ()
* see if a fixed grammar will 

submit grammar (original one)

change grammar (learn in context) (fix)

* IN the same grammar -> 

context-window bige enougn for both




---

prompt that inclkude the grammar (can the llm learn)

* my prompt, not only the grammar

* need to answer, can the llm learn from the grammar itself -> NO, why?

* my approach vs only grammar

make the dsl more digestable

-> plain vanilla DSL grammar as is

--> what are the results (R1)

-> attempts to solve it (not vanilla) (R2)

is it better?

-> prompt strategy (R3)

Look at attempt -> formulate the strategy -> formulate new prompt -> 


Look at the improvements for only one case

--> 3rd party libaries is a separate chapter
