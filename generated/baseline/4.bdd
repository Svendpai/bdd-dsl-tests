To satisfy your e-commerce website requirements using the provided DSL grammar, we need to define entities for the items, the shopping cart, and the wishlist. We'll also define scenarios for viewing the catalog on the home page, viewing item details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and checking out. Here's how the DSL code might look:

```plaintext
model e_commerce_website

entity Catalog is {
    actions:
        viewCatalog
    properties:
        items*
}

entity Item {
    actions:
        viewDetails, addToCart, addToWishlist
    states:
        inCatalog / notInCatalog
    properties:
        picture, name, price, description, reviews*
}

entity ShoppingCart {
    actions:
        addItem, removeItem, checkout
    properties:
        items*
}

entity Wishlist {
    actions:
        addItem, removeItem
    properties:
        items*
}

Scenario: ViewingCatalog
    Given the Catalog
    When I viewCatalog
    Then the Item is inCatalog

Scenario: ViewingItemDetails
    Given the Item is inCatalog
    When I viewDetails for the Item
    Then the Item shows picture, name, price, description, reviews

Scenario: AddingItemToCart
    Given the Item is inCatalog
    When I addToCart for the Item
    Then the Item is in the ShoppingCart

Scenario: AddingItemToWishlist
    Given the Item is inCatalog
    When I addToWishlist for the Item
    Then the Item is in the Wishlist

Scenario: CheckingOut
    Given the ShoppingCart has items
    When I checkout
    Then the ShoppingCart is empty
```

This DSL code outlines the basic functionality of your e-commerce site, defining the key entities involved (Catalog, Item, ShoppingCart, Wishlist) and the actions you can perform on them (viewing the catalog, viewing item details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, checking out). The scenarios describe how these actions translate into changes in the state of the system, adhering to the Behavior-Driven Development approach.
