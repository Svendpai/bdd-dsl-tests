To create a DSL code snippet based on the provided requirements and the defined grammar, we need to define entities for the e-commerce website, including their actions, states, and properties, along with scenarios that describe the interactions on the website.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Entities**: `Product`, `HomePage`, `ProductDetailsPage`, `ShoppingCart`, `Wishlist`
2. **Actions**:
   - `View` (for viewing the catalog on the home page and product details on the product details page)
   - `Add` (for adding items to the shopping cart or wishlist)
   - `Checkout` (for checking out items in the shopping cart)
3. **States**:
   - `Displayed` (for items on the home page)
   - `Detailed` (for showing detailed information on the product details page)
   - `InCart`, `InWishlist` (for items added to the cart or wishlist)
4. **Properties**: `Picture`, `ProductName`, `Price`, `MoreInformation`, `Reviews`

Based on these, here is an example of DSL code that describes the e-commerce website for selling high-end office chairs:

```dsl
model OfficeChairsECommerce

entity HomePage {
  actions:
    View
  properties:
    ProductName*, Picture*, Price*
}

entity Product - Displayed is HomePage {
  actions:
    View
  properties:
    MoreInformation, Reviews
}

entity ProductDetailsPage - Detailed is Product {
  actions:
    Add to ShoppingCart, Add to Wishlist
}

entity ShoppingCart {
  actions:
    Add, Checkout
  states:
    InCart
}

entity Wishlist {
  actions:
    Add
  states:
    InWishlist
}

Scenario: ViewingProductsOnHomePage
Given the HomePage
When I View
Then the ProductName, Picture, and Price are Displayed

Scenario: ViewingProductDetails
Given the HomePage
When I View a Product
Then the ProductDetailsPage is Detailed with MoreInformation and Reviews

Scenario: AddingProductToShoppingCart
Given the ProductDetailsPage
When I Add the Product to ShoppingCart
Then the Product is InCart

Scenario: AddingProductToWishlist
Given the ProductDetailsPage
When I Add the Product to Wishlist
Then the Product is InWishlist

Scenario: CheckoutShoppingCart
Given the ShoppingCart with Products InCart
When I Checkout
Then the Checkout is Completed
```

This DSL code defines the necessary entities, actions, states, and properties to model the e-commerce website's functionality according to the requirements. Each scenario outlines a specific user interaction flow, such as viewing products on the home page, viewing product details, adding products to the shopping cart or wishlist, and checking out.
