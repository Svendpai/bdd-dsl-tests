To create a DSL code based on the provided grammar for the e-commerce website requirements, we need to define entities for the website components (such as catalog, item, shopping cart, and wishlist) and specify the actions and states relevant to browsing, reviewing, and purchasing products. Here's an example of how the DSL code could be structured:

```plaintext
model ECommerceWebsite

entity HomePage {
    actions:
        viewCatalog
}

entity Catalog {
    states:
        itemVisible on / itemNotVisible off
    properties:
        picture, productName, price
}

entity Item {
    actions:
        viewDetails, addToCart, addToWishlist
    states:
        detailsVisible on / detailsNotVisible off
    properties:
        picture, productName, price, description, reviews
}

entity ShoppingCart {
    actions:
        checkout
    states:
        itemAdded on / itemNotAdded off
    properties:
        items*
}

entity Wishlist {
    actions:
        addItem, removeItem
    states:
        itemAdded on / itemNotAdded off
    properties:
        items*
}

Scenario: ViewingCatalog
    Given the HomePage
    When I viewCatalog
    Then the Catalog is itemVisible

Scenario: ViewingItemDetails
    Given the Catalog is itemVisible
    When I viewDetails on the Item
    Then the Item is detailsVisible

Scenario: AddingItemToCart
    Given the Item is detailsVisible
    When I addToCart on the Item
    Then the ShoppingCart is itemAdded

Scenario: AddingItemToWishlist
    Given the Item is detailsVisible
    When I addToWishlist on the Item
    Then the Wishlist is itemAdded

Scenario: CheckingOut
    Given the ShoppingCart is itemAdded
    When I checkout
    Then the ShoppingCart is itemNotAdded
```

This DSL code outlines the basic structure and functionality of the e-commerce website:

1. **HomePage** entity represents the landing page where the catalog can be viewed.
2. **Catalog** entity lists all the items, showing only their picture, name, and price. The state indicates whether an item is visible or not.
3. **Item** entity represents the details of a product, including actions for viewing more details, adding to the cart, and adding to the wishlist. The properties include all the details that can be shown on the full details page.
4. **ShoppingCart** and **Wishlist** entities manage the items added to the cart and wishlist, respectively, with actions for adding, removing, and checking out items.

Each scenario describes a specific user interaction with the website, following the Given-When-Then BDD format, which outlines the preconditions, the action taken, and the expected outcome.
