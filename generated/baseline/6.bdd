To create a DSL code based on the provided grammar for an e-commerce website selling high-end office chairs, we'll define entities for the home page, product details, shopping cart, and wishlist. We'll also outline scenarios for viewing the catalog, viewing product details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and checking out.

```plaintext
model ECommerceWebsite

entity HomePage is {
    actions:
        viewCatalog on the HomePage
    properties:

        addToCart
        addToWishlist
    states:
        displayed / not displayed
    properties:
        picture
        name
        price
        description

}

entity ShoppingCart {
    actions:
        addItem
        checkout
    properties:
        items* of Product
}

entity Wishlist {
    actions:
        addItem
    properties:

This DSL code outlines the basic functionality of the e-commerce website, focusing on the key requirements: viewing products on the home page, accessing full product details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and checking out. Each entity represents a component of the website, and the scenarios describe the interactions a user might have with these components. This code can be expanded or modified to include more specific details or additional features as needed.
