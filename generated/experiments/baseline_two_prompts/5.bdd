To satisfy your requirements using the defined DSL, we will define a model for the e-commerce website that includes entities for the home page, product details page, shopping cart, and wishlist. Each entity will have actions and properties relevant to their functionality. The scenarios will outline the user interactions such as viewing products, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and checking out.

```plaintext
model ECommerceWebsite

entity HomePage {
    properties:
        catalog* // List of items to display on the home page
    actions:
        selectItem // User selects an item to view its details
}

entity ProductDetailsPage {
    properties:
        picture
        name
        price
        description
        reviews*
    actions:
        addToCart
        addToWishlist
}

entity ShoppingCart {
    properties:
        items* // List of items added to the shopping cart
    actions:
        checkout // Finalize the purchase of items in the cart
}

entity Wishlist {
    properties:
        items* // List of items added to the wishlist
    actions:
        moveToCart(item) // Move an item from the wishlist to the shopping cart
}

Scenario: ViewProductDetails
    Given the HomePage
    When I selectItem
    Then the ProductDetailsPage is displayed

Scenario: AddToCart
    Given the ProductDetailsPage
    When I addToCart
    Then the item is in the ShoppingCart

Scenario: AddToWishlist
    Given the ProductDetailsPage
    When I addToWishlist
    Then the item is in the Wishlist

Scenario: Checkout
    Given the ShoppingCart
    When I checkout
    Then the purchase is completed

Scenario: MoveItemToCartFromWishlist
    Given the Wishlist
    When I moveToCart an item
    Then the item is in the ShoppingCart and not in the Wishlist
```

This DSL code defines the basic structure and interactions for your e-commerce website. The `HomePage` entity represents the initial view with a catalog of items. The `ProductDetailsPage` entity provides more detailed information about a product and allows adding to the cart or wishlist. The `ShoppingCart` and `Wishlist` entities manage the items the user intends to purchase or save for later, with actions to checkout or move items between the cart and wishlist. The scenarios outline typical user stories for interacting with the website.
