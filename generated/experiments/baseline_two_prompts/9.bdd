Based on the requirements for an e-commerce website for selling high-end office chairs with specific functionalities, here is how you might use the defined DSL grammar to model this scenario:

```dsl
model OfficeChairStore
{
    // Define entities for the e-commerce website
    entity HomePage {
        actions:
            viewCatalog
        properties:
            itemPicture, itemName, itemPrice
    }
    
    entity ItemDetailsPage {
        actions:
            viewMoreInfo, viewReviews, addToCart, addToWishlist, buyItem
        states:
            itemSelected / itemNotSelected
        properties:
            detailedInfo, reviews
    }
    
    entity ShoppingCart {
        actions:
            addItem, removeItem, checkout
        states:
            itemInCart / itemNotInCart
    }
    
    entity Wishlist {
        actions:
            addItem, removeItem
        states:
            itemInWishlist / itemNotInWishlist
    }

    // Define scenarios for interacting with the e-commerce website
    Scenario: ViewItemDetails
        Given the HomePage
        When I viewCatalog and the itemName is selected
        Then the ItemDetailsPage is shown

    Scenario: AddItemToCart
        Given the ItemDetailsPage
        When I select an item and addToCart
        Then the item is itemInCart in the ShoppingCart

    Scenario: AddItemToWishlist
        Given the ItemDetailsPage
        When I select an item and addToWishlist
        Then the item is itemInWishlist in the Wishlist

    Scenario: CheckoutItems
        Given the ShoppingCart
        When I checkout
        Then the items are bought and the ShoppingCart is empty

    Scenario: RemoveItemFromCart
        Given the ShoppingCart with itemInCart
        When I removeItem
        Then the item is itemNotInCart

    Scenario: RemoveItemFromWishlist
        Given the Wishlist with itemInWishlist
        When I removeItem
        Then the item is itemNotInWishlist
}
```

This DSL code outlines the basic structure of your e-commerce website, defining entities for the main components like the home page, item details page, shopping cart, and wishlist. It also specifies possible actions for each entity, such as viewing the catalog, adding items to the cart or wishlist, checking out, and more. Additionally, it includes scenarios that describe the interactions a user might have with the website, such as viewing item details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and checking out.

Keep in mind that this DSL code is an abstraction and serves as a high-level model of your requirements. The actual implementation details would depend on the specific technologies and frameworks you choose for building the e-commerce website.
