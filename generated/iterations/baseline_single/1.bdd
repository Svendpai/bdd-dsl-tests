To create a DSL code for your e-commerce website requirement based on the provided grammar, we'll define entities, their properties, actions, and states, then craft scenarios that encapsulate the user journey from viewing the catalog to making a purchase and adding items to the wishlist or cart.

```xtext
model HighEndOfficeChairs

entity "Product" {
    properties: 
        name*
        price*
        picture*
        description
        reviews*
    actions:
        view "details"
        add to "cart"
        add to "wishlist"
        buy
}

entity "Cart" {
    actions:
        checkout
    properties:
        items*
}

entity "Wishlist" {
    properties:
        items*
}

entity "User" {
    actions:
        view "catalog"
        access "cart"
        access "wishlist"
}

Scenario: ViewingCatalog
    Given the User
    When I view "catalog"
    Then the Product name, Product price, and Product picture are visible on "home page"

Scenario: ViewingProductDetails
    Given the User
    And the Product
    When I view details of the Product
    Then the Product description and Product reviews are visible on "details page"

Scenario: AddingProductToCart
    Given the User
    And the Product
    When I add the Product to cart
    Then the Cart items include the Product

Scenario: AddingProductToWishlist
    Given the User
    And the Product
    When I add the Product to wishlist
    Then the Wishlist items include the Product

Scenario: CheckoutFromCart
    Given the User
    And the Cart with items
    When I checkout
    Then the Purchase is confirmed
```

This DSL code defines the core entities involved in your e-commerce platform, such as `Product`, `Cart`, `Wishlist`, and `User`. Each entity has its relevant properties and actions. The scenarios describe the user's journey through the platform, from browsing the product catalog to viewing product details, adding items to the cart or wishlist, and finally checking out.
