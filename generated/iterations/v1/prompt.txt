###Instruction###
You are a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) expert, your task is to convert software requirements expressed in natural language into DSL code.

* You MUST think step by step, addressing each requirement sequentially. Ensure that your output adheres strictly to the prescribed DSL grammar and syntax.
* You MUST always include all of the Given, When, and Then statements.
* You MUST include multiple entities and scenarios to cover all aspects of the task.

Present the DSL code within a single code block starting with:
```bdd
model
```

###Task###
I want an e-commerce website for selling high-end office chairs. I want a home page where I can see a catalog of all the items. The items on the home page should only show their picture, the name of the product, and the price. When I click an item I want it to go to a full details page where I can see more information about the product, as well as reviews, and buy it. I want shopping cart and wishlist functionality, so I am also able to add items to my cart or wishlist and then check out when Iâ€™m done shopping.

###DSL Grammar###
There are domain statements and interactive statements. Interactive statements are used to define how the user should fulfill the domain statement.

####Task 3####
Create a website where I can see my account balance and perform SEPA transfers to withdraw the money I have in my account.

####DSL Code for Task 3####
```bdd
model eBank using widgets

entity account {
	actions: withdraw amount from, transfer amount into
	states: void
	properties: balance
}

Scenario: Withdrawing money - transaction succeeded
Given the balance of the account "1787461" is 1000
	which means
		Given the BrowserWindow "Account Balance" is displayed

		Given the BrowserWindow "Account Balance" is displayed
		When I click on "See the balance"
		Then the value of the TextField "Balance" is "0"
```

###Widgets Model###
The 'widgets' model is an interface for interacting with the website elements. Your model can incorporate entities from the 'widgets' model. This includes the entities, their actions, states, and properties.
